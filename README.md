# JARVIS-PROJECT
🚀 Introducing My Simple AI Assistant - JARVIS! 🤖
I know it’s not perfect, but this is my first little project,💙 I’ve built a basic version of JARVIS using Python, capable of performing simple tasks like opening websites and playing music. While it’s just the beginning, I’m excited to continue improving it and adding more advanced features soon.
🔧 Current Features:
 ✔️ Open Google, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn with voice commands
 ✔️ Play music directly from my library 🎶

Note: My voice isn’t included in the demo video, but the functionality is fully working! 🎤
It’s a small step, but it’s a meaningful one. Can’t wait to take JARVIS to the next level! Stay tuned for future updates as I work on making it smarter and more powerful. 💡
